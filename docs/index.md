## Summary

"Wake the F up!!" also know as WakeUp helps the user function better after very little sleep. Helping you to focus and be productive for work, school or other important things you have going on. This app helps you get through the day to make sure you are productive and ready to go for anything you have going on. Throughout the day it can notify you with a little motivation to give you that extra push. When using the app users can select different tasks, activities and options that can be  personalized to ensure the best type of help to get you through the day.

I chose to develop WakeUp because before starting the Deep Dive Bootcamp I had worked the grave-yard shift for 11 years. I always had a hard time waking up since I was getting very little sleep. It got much worse once I had children and would take care of them during the day while my wife went to work. My daughter recently started school in the fall and I had to be there with her every morning getting her ready to do her remote learning. Most days I was running on fumes, forgetting if I had to do something around the house before heading to work. This app can hopefully help people who ever in my shoes, improve their day and help get their days be more functional than my days used to be.

WakeUp will let users make lists of tasks needed to be done. Show you which tasks need to be done. Helping you stay ready to accomplish whatever tasks head your way. 

* Select different activities that will notify the user wake up such as

	* Stretching

	* Deep breathing

	* Going on walks

* Add tasks that you need to accomplish during the day.
